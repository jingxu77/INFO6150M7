            <h2>What is Glaucoma?</h2>
            <p>Glaucoma is an eye disease that damages the optic nerve, often due to high pressure in the eye, and can
                lead to blindness if not treated. It's more common in older adults and can run in families.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Causes of glaucoma -->
        <section>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Glaucoma usually happens when eye fluid doesn't flow out properly, increasing eye pressure. Sometimes,
                the
                cause is unknown, but it can be genetic or due to eye injury, infection, or surgery.</p>

        <!-- Symptoms of glaucoma -->
        <section>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Glaucoma is particularly challenging because it often does not present early symptoms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No early symptoms in many cases</li>
                <li>Open-angle glaucoma leads to gradual peripheral vision loss</li>
                <li>Angle-closure glaucoma causes sudden severe eye pain, redness, vision loss, and seeing halos</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Diagnosis of glaucoma -->
        <section>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Doctors use various tests like eye exams, pressure measurements, and imaging to check for glaucoma.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Treatment of glaucoma -->
        <section>
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>Treatment for glaucoma aims to lower eye pressure and includes medications, laser treatment, or surgery.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eye drops or pills</li>
